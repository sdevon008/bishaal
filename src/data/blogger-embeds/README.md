## Customization

You can customize the embeds by modifying:

- `width` and `height` values in the iframe
- The style attributes to match your blog's design
- The description text in the footer area

## Notes

- The embeds use responsive design and will adapt to the container width
- Loading is set to "lazy" for better performance
- Make sure your blog platform allows iframe embeds
- If your blog has a Content Security Policy (CSP), you may need to adjust it to allow iframes from yournepalapp.com

## Troubleshooting

If the embed is not working on your blog:

1. Make sure iframes are allowed on your blog platform
2. Check if the URL in the iframe's src attribute is correct
3. Try adjusting the height if content appears cut off
4. Ensure your blog's theme supports responsive iframes
